# Continuations

This is an implementation of 'Continuations' for Java created as an exercise. It is not a reliable library and should not be used for production purposes. Don't blame me if you try and it all goes wrong, but do drop me a line with all the gory details!

A short write up is online at [paperstack.com](http://paperstack.com/post/2019/04/30/continuations-continued/).

If you submit this as your homework as a solution to a Fibonacci exercise then I dare say that you will get everything you deserve.
